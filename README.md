🎬 Movie Recommendation Engine
A machine learning-based movie recommendation system built using Python, designed to suggest movies to users based on their past ratings and preferences. This project demonstrates the power of collaborative filtering and content similarity using real-world movie data.

📌 Project Motivation
Recommender systems are at the heart of services like Netflix and Amazon. This project aims to implement a simple yet effective version of such a system using available movie metadata and user rating datasets.

🧠 Features
✅ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
⭐ Popularity-Based Recommendation
👥 Collaborative Filtering (User-Item Matrix)
🔍 Cosine Similarity for Finding Similar Movies
🧮 k-Nearest Neighbors for Recommendation

🗂️ Dataset Description
- `Movies.csv`: Contains movie `movieId`, `title`, and `genres`.
- `ratings-n.csv`: Contains `userId`, `movieId`, `rating`, and `timestamp`.

These datasets are derived from the [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), widely used in recommendation research.

🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-engine.git
   cd movie-recommendation-engine
2. Install required libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Launch the notebook:
   jupyter notebook Movie_Recommendation_Engine.ipynb
4.Follow the notebook steps to:
 Clean the data
 Build recommendation models
 View similar movies or top-rated suggestions

🛠️ Tech Stack
  Python 3.x
  Jupyter Notebook
  Pandas, NumPy
  scikit-learn
  Seaborn, Matplotlib

💡 Example Use Cases
🔎 Find movies similar to a selected title
🌟 Recommend top-rated movies to a user
📉 Visualize rating trends and distributions

📈 Future Improvements
Add content-based filtering using NLP on movie descriptions
Integrate with a simple web interface (Flask / Streamlit)
